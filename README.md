# NMSI Exponential Operator Demo

This repository contains a minimal demonstration of the exponential operator `e` used in the
NMSI–π*–HDQG–e framework for Navier–Stokes regularization.

## Files
- `exponential_operator_demo.py`: Python script implementing the exponential operator with a demo.
- `README.md`: Project description and usage instructions.

## Usage
Run the Python file to see the exponential operator applied to a synthetic vorticity field:

```bash
python exponential_operator_demo.py
```

This will print both the original and regularized values, illustrating exponential damping.
