# NMSI Turbulence Integration

This package demonstrates how to integrate the NMSI–π*–γ_diss–e* operators into turbulence models (RANS/LES)
for hypersonic and high-Re flows.

Includes:
- Sensor definition for γ_diss (Ducros + Cp-gradient + Mach filter)
- RANS modifications (ν_t and Pk gating)
- LES modifications (ν_sgs modulation)
- Heat flux reduction demo
- Validation workflow for flat plate, ramp, sphere-cone
